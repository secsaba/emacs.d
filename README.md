# My Emacs settings

My current set of settings of Emacs settings.

## Setup

To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d, i.e. ensure that the init.el in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

   $ git clone git://github.com/secsaba/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d

The first time you start Emacs, it will install some additional packages.

## Install Emacs on macOS

   $ sudo port install emacs-app
